description: How to write business logic inside a global-architecture service with clean architecture - aggregates and invariants in src/domain, use cases in src/application that take the acting user first, authorization rules (ownership, visibility, admin role, 404 vs 403, typed list scopes), ports as abstract classes, DomainError kinds and reasons, validation split between transport and domain, UnitOfWork transactions, ids and time. Use it whenever you add or change a business rule, entity, aggregate, use case, error, permission or ownership check, status/state machine or validation in any *-service, or when deciding which layer a piece of code belongs to.

# Domain and application layers

Business logic must be testable without Nest, gRPC or Postgres, and portable if the
transport or ORM changes. That is why `src/domain` is plain TypeScript and
`src/application` only orchestrates through ports.

## Anatomy (booking-service is the richest example)

```
src/domain/booking.ts            aggregate: state, create(), restore(), behaviour (cancel), isVisibleTo(actor)
src/domain/booking-scope.ts      who sees which rows: bookingScopeFor(actor, party) -> BookingScope
src/domain/stay.ts               value logic (date rules) as pure functions
src/domain/booking.errors.ts     error factories: bookingNotFound(id), datesUnavailable(houseId)
src/domain/booking.repository.ts persistence port (abstract class)
src/application/booking.service.ts            use cases, the actor as first argument
src/application/ports/house-catalog.ts        port for another service's data
```

## Aggregates

```ts
export class House {
  private constructor(private state: HouseState) {}
  static create(input: {...}, now: Date): House  // validates and normalizes everything
  static restore(state: HouseState): House       // rebuilds from storage; trusts the DB
  update(changes: HouseChanges, now: Date): void // behaviour enforces invariants
  assertManageableBy(actor: Actor): void         // authorization rule: owner or admin
  toState(): HouseState                          // copy out for persistence and mapping
}
```

- State is private and only changes through intention-revealing methods
  (`cancel(now)`, `update(changes, now)`), so invariants cannot be bypassed.
- `now` is a parameter: the use case passes `this.clock.now()`, tests pass a fixed date.
- Normalize at the boundary of the aggregate (trim, lower-case emails, upper-case
  country codes) so stored data is canonical.
- Return copies from `toState()`; never hand out the mutable state.
- A state machine is a method that checks the current state:
  `if (this.state.status === 'CANCELLED') throw bookingAlreadyCancelled(id)`.
- Rules that span many aggregates or need atomicity under concurrency (uniqueness,
  no-overlap) belong to the database (`ga-database`), not to an in-memory check.

## Actors and authorization (ADR-0004)

Who acts is a parameter, like `now`. The controller takes it from the verified request
(`currentUser()` from `@ga/service-kit`) and passes it as the use case's **first**
argument. Use cases and the domain never read request context, so every rule is visible
in a unit test and a second transport cannot skip it.

```ts
// src/transport/grpc/house.grpc-controller.ts
@Access.user()
async updateHouse(request: UpdateHouseRequest): Promise<UpdateHouseResponse> {
  const { id, ...changes } = parseRequest(UpdateHouseRequestSchema, request);
  return { house: toHouseMessage(await this.houses.update(currentUser(), id, changes)) };
}

// src/application/house.service.ts
update(actor: UserActor, id: string, changes: HouseChanges): Promise<House> {
  return this.unitOfWork.run(async () => {
    const house = await this.houses.findById(id, { forUpdate: true });
    if (!house) throw houseNotFound(id);
    house.assertManageableBy(actor); // the rule lives in the aggregate
    house.update(changes, this.clock.now());
    await this.houses.update(house);
    return house;
  });
}
```

- Actor types and helpers come from `@ga/kernel` (`Actor`, `UserActor`, `IdentityActor`,
  `ServiceActor`, `isAdmin`, `adminRoleRequired()`), so the domain may use them. Verified
  actors are branded: only the service kit creates them from checked tokens, and
  `pnpm lint` fails a cast to one.
- New data belongs to the actor (`ownerId: actor.userId`, `guestId: actor.userId`), never
  to an id from the request.
- Put each rule on the aggregate: `House.assertManageableBy(actor)` throws,
  `Booking.isVisibleTo(actor)` and `User.isVisibleTo(actor)` return a boolean and the use
  case throws its not-found error. Check writes under the row lock (`forUpdate`), so the
  check and the change cannot interleave.
- **404 or 403.** If the caller may not know the resource exists (bookings, users, the
  template's items), throw the same `NotFoundError` as for a missing one: same reason,
  same message. If the resource is visible to the caller (the public house catalogue)
  but the action is not allowed, throw a `PermissionDeniedError` (`HOUSE_PERMISSION_DENIED`).
- Admin-only: `if (!isAdmin(actor)) throw adminRoleRequired();` (PERMISSION_DENIED,
  reason `ADMIN_ROLE_REQUIRED`).
- **Lists never fail on visibility.** A domain function turns the actor into a typed
  scope (`bookingScopeFor(actor, party)` -> `BookingScope`), and the repository port takes
  the scope, so no list can forget to filter. Only asking for more than the actor may see
  fails (`party: 'any'` without the admin role -> `ADMIN_ROLE_REQUIRED`).
- A use case that checks scope or role before its first `await` is declared `async`, so
  a refusal rejects the returned promise instead of throwing synchronously
  (`BookingService.list`, `UserService.list`).
- Facts a rule needs from another service are snapshotted when they cannot change
  (`Booking.hostId` is the house owner at booking time), so the check needs no remote call.
- Unit tests build actors with `userActor(id, roles?)`, `adminActor(id)`,
  `identityActor(issuer, subject, email?)` and `serviceActor(name)` from
  `@ga/kernel/testing`; production code never imports it (`pnpm lint`).

## Errors: pick the kind by what the caller should do

| `UnauthenticatedError`                 | UNAUTHENTICATED / 401     | raised by the platform only (gateway token checks, the service kit, `currentUser()` without a user); use cases always receive a verified actor                                                                                                                 |

Constructors: `new NotFoundError(reason, message, metadata?)` and the same
`(reason, message, metadata = {}, options?)` for every kind except
`new ValidationError(message, violations = [], reason = 'VALIDATION_FAILED')`.

Write a factory per error in `<noun>.errors.ts` with a stable UPPER_SNAKE `reason`
prefixed by the aggregate (`BOOKING_DATES_UNAVAILABLE`). Clients branch on `reason`,
so never change an existing one. Messages and metadata are returned to API clients:
write them for API users, include only identifiers the caller already knows.

## Validation: two layers, two jobs

1. **Transport** (`src/transport/grpc/*.requests.ts`, Zod + `parseRequest`): shape and
   format. Is `id` a UUID, is `email` an email, are numbers integers within range.
   Rejects garbage before any work and returns precise field violations. Deprecated
   request fields that used to carry identities are left out of the schema, so they are
   ignored.
2. **Domain** (aggregate methods): business invariants, using the same limits, because
   the domain must protect itself whoever calls it.

The duplication of a few limits (max lengths) is intentional; export the constants from
the domain file when you want one source.

## Use cases

```ts
@Injectable()
export class BookingService {
  constructor(
    private readonly bookings: BookingRepository, // ports: abstract classes
    private readonly users: UserDirectory,
    private readonly houses: HouseCatalog,
    private readonly ids: IdGenerator, // from @ga/kernel, bound by the kit
    private readonly clock: Clock,
    private readonly unitOfWork: UnitOfWork,
  ) {}

  async create(actor: UserActor, input: CreateBookingInput): Promise<Booking> { ... }
  async get(actor: UserActor, id: string): Promise<Booking> { ... }
}
```

- One public method per use case; it reads like the business process. A use case that
  acts for someone takes the actor first.
- Do cheap local validation before remote calls; run independent remote calls in
  parallel (`Promise.all`).
- **Never hold a database transaction open across a remote call.**
- Read-modify-write goes inside `this.unitOfWork.run(...)` with
  `findById(id, { forUpdate: true })`, so concurrent updates serialize instead of
  overwriting each other. Repositories called inside `run()` join the transaction
  automatically, and a nested `run()` joins the outer transaction too (no savepoint):
  an error anywhere rolls back everything. Do not nest `run()` expecting partial rollback.
- Single-statement writes (insert, delete) do not need a unit of work.
- Imports allowed: domain, `@ga/kernel`, `@nestjs/common` (`Injectable`, `Logger`).
  Constructor parameters that are classes must be **value imports** (DI metadata);
  only interfaces/types use `import type`.

## Ports

A port is an abstract class named after what the domain needs, not after the provider:
`UserDirectory.stillExists(actor)`, `HouseCatalog.findTerms(id)`, not `UserServiceClient`.
Keep the port's return types in domain terms (`HouseTerms`), which makes the adapter an
anti-corruption layer and keeps another service's contract out of your domain.
Bind it in `app.module.ts`: `{ provide: HouseCatalog, useClass: GrpcHouseCatalog }`.

## Logging inside use cases

```ts
private readonly logger = new Logger(BookingService.name);
this.logger.log(`booking ${id} cancelled`);
```

The request id is attached automatically. Every RPC already gets one structured line
with method, status, duration, calling workload and user id, so log business events, not
entry/exit. Never log emails, names or tokens. Logging is optional; when a use case logs,
its unit tests (which construct the class without Nest) print those lines unless the spec
calls `Logger.overrideLogger(false)` in `beforeAll`.
